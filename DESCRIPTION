Description: Allows one to download and run Osmosis from R. Osmosis is a
    command line application for processing OpenStreetMap data which
    consists of several different pluggable components that can be chained
    to perform large operations. The package currently does not aim to
    offer functions that covers the entirety of Osmosis' API, and instead
    offers limited support to running Osmosis through a helper function.
